## 🔧 Deployment Process

### Step 1: Pre-Deployment Verification

```bash
# Run comprehensive pre-deployment checks
./scripts/verify-deployment.sh --pre-deploy

# Security audit
npm run security:audit

# Performance check
npm run performance:analyze
```

### Step 2: Database Preparation

```bash
# Backup production database
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Run migrations (if any)
npm run db:migrate:deploy
```

### Step 3: Deployment Execution

```bash
# Execute production deployment
./scripts/deploy-production.sh

# Or for manual deployment:
npm run production:deploy
```

### Step 4: Post-Deployment Verification

```bash
# Verify deployment health
./scripts/verify-deployment.sh --post-deploy

# Monitor application metrics
npm run monitoring:verify
```
