## Technical Implementation

### Component Architecture
```
src/components/dashboard/
├── VantaInspiredDashboard.tsx    # Main dashboard container
├── MetricCards.tsx               # Animated metric cards
├── ComplianceProgress.tsx        # Progress rings & framework tracking
└── (Enhanced) RiskHeatMap.tsx    # Interactive risk matrix
```

### Route Implementation
- **Demo route created:** `/dashboard/vanta-demo`
- **Page component:** `src/app/dashboard/vanta-demo/page.tsx`
- **Direct access** to Vanta-inspired dashboard interface

### Key Features
- **TypeScript interfaces** for type safety and maintainability
- **React hooks** for state management and lifecycle handling
- **Tailwind CSS** for consistent styling and responsive design
- **Lucide React icons** for modern iconography
- **shadcn/ui components** for consistent UI elements

## Vanta Design Pattern Adoption

### Header Design
- Clean, minimal header with clear hierarchy
- Search functionality prominently placed
- Action buttons grouped logically
- Real-time status indicators

### Metric Cards
- Large, bold numbers for key metrics
- Trend indicators with directional arrows
- Color-coded status indicators
- Consistent card layouts with proper spacing

### Data Visualization
- Interactive heatmaps with hover states
- Progress rings with animated fills
- Status badges with contextual colors
- Tabbed content organization

### Color Scheme
- Primary: #199BEC (Riscura brand blue)
- Success: Green variants for positive metrics
- Warning: Yellow/Orange for at-risk items
- Error: Red variants for critical issues
- Neutral: Gray scale for secondary information

## User Experience Enhancements
